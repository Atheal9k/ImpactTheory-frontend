# Impact Theory Front End

This is the front end website which users will interact with.

Currently it only supports Metamask Connection.

If you want to support more wallet connections...
You can either create a new front end if you wish or wait for mine as I will add support for other wallets in the future.

# Setup

## API Endpoint

Go to line 69 in

### `./src/App.js`

Replace the endpoint to the one set up on the backend.
It most likely will be the server you deployed the bot on + '/verificationBot/verifyAddress'
